\title{Calculates dilated time}
\usage{
dilated_time(proper_time, speed)
}
\arguments{
\item{proper_time}{The time on the object. Whatever units
are chosen here will also be the units of the results.}

\item{speed}{Speed of moving object in m/s}
}
\value{
Returns the dilated time in units chosen for proper_time
}
\description{
Calculates dilated time (perspective of stationary observer)
from proper time experienced on object moving at a particular
speed
}
\examples{
curve(dilated_time(1, light_speed(x)), 0, .99,
      xlab = "Speed (as proprtion of speed of light)",
      ylab = "Dilated time",
      main = "Dilated time when proper time = 1")
}
